            <h1>Get to know me!</h1>
            <p>Today, i'm a man. Tomorrow, i could be a fruit, basking in the warm sunlight on a remote island in Greece and the next day after that, i could be a bald eagle, soaring high above the surface of the atlantic, wings outstretched. I could be anything, which would make getting to know me a tad bit difficult but one thing i know i'll never be, is a Manchester United fan.</p>
            <h2>Why am i here?</h2>
            <p>I have always liked design and how things appear. I satrted designing, as a kid, with microsoft word. Whenever we were given posters in church, i always looked forward to getting behind my father's desktop and trying my best to replicate the designs. Later, i got familiar with canva and then when i started photography, i started editing pictures too. Now, i'm here, learning software engineering and looking forward to do something in animation.</p>
            <h3>What is success like to me?</h3>
            <p>Success could mean many things but it's the personal meaning that matters. In a world where God is in absolute control but we are also on the receiving end of the consequences of the actions of others, it helps to narrow things down. No, i am not saying success should be a reactive metric bourne out of pessimism and a defeatist mentality, but that reaching one such metric should be rooted in reality and then, maybe, wrapped with optimism. But contextually, success, to me, would mean being able to do things that, at the start of the program, i could not do. I want to build a foundation with everything we'll be taught and then get creative with building on top of that foundation through further exposure and extraneous learning. In a way, there's intentionality to it but there's also the side of being carried on the wings, or adrift the sea of providence. The goal is to do. To be better. To serve humanity. To please God. </p>
            <p>It is I</p>
